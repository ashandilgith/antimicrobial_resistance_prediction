# antimicrobial_resistance_prediction
Developing a machine learning approach for reducing the time for anti-microbial resistance prediction. Using a random forest and other machine learning models, the objective is to reduce prediction time by at least 50% from manual approaches. The ideal end result is saving more lives in critical health, and enhanced profitability in agriculture.
